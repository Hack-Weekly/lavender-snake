This is the express server! It is mostly just boilerplate, but for now I added a count controller.  To run, execute:
  `npm install && DEBUG=server:* npm start

(the install can be omitted if you don't have anything that needs install).

note: this will *not* hot reload; if you change something on the server, you will need to stop and restart.  Not sure if this is something that can be fixed or not.

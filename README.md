Repo for Lavender Snake team!

You can see the running app at https://lavender-snake-wgikiljsnq-uc.a.run.app/ (you'll need a google login to use it)

This repo is organized into 2 components (for now):
client - where the web client (react) code goes
server - where our web server (express) code goes
